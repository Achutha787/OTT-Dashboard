🛏 OTT Dashboard Project
🔷 I'm delighted to share that recently I have completed an OTT Dashboard project in the entertainment domain under
 the guidance of iNeuron.ai.
🔷 In this project we are provided with the Datasets and based on that we had to create an interactive OTT Dashboard.
🔷 It was a great learning experience while doing an internship at iNeuron.ai.

⚠️Problem statement:-
Business Scenario: To find out more about movies,webseries with their directors,duration and necessary metrics
 to make predictions and draw some  conclusions about AmazonPrime,DisneyHotstar and Netflix. 

🎯Objective:-
Our Major Objective was to analyze OTT data to gain insights into customer behavior, market trends, reviews, and
 ratings of the movies or webseries.

🔍 Finding:-

DisneyHotstar:

🔷TV-G showed an increase of 2.22% whereas Movies decrease by 69.52% trended down between 2019 and 2021.
🔷TV-G accounted for 21.93% of the total videos.

Netflix:

🔷The most recent Sum of Awards Received anomaly was in 2015, when Movie had a high of 19842.
🔷Number of Awards Received for Movies (94.37% decrease) and Series (90.06% decrease)
 both trended down between 2015 and 2021.
🔷Average number of movies(1671) was higher  than Series (540.43).
🔷Total number of Movies (11,697) higher than Series (3783).

AmazonPrime:

🔷13+ accounted for 22.04% of number of movies/series.
🔷Movies accounted for 80.04% of the videos

⚙️Tools used:-
. Excel
. Power Query
. Microsoft Power Bi, Dax & Services
. NovyPro

🔷 So this is the Dashboard that we have designed for Visualization Purposes in Power BI by
 using a Line and Stacked column 📊 chart, Map, buttons, Bookmark, and Slicer with the help of
 which we could filter the data.
